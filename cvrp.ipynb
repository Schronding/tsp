    "Your classmates' **route choices are actually better** than the greedy algorithm — their actual total is **326 km** (24,450 MXN), which beats the algorithm's 328 km (24,600 MXN) by 2 km.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, their **arithmetic has some errors**:\n",
    "- **Trip a** (P→1→4→6→5→P): they forgot to count the full return from node 5 back to P, which goes 5→6→3→1→P = 43 km. Actual is 84, not 82. (**+2 km**)\n",
    "- **Trip b** (P→1→4→P): the return from node 4 goes 4→3→1→P = 33 km. Actual is 59, not 52. (**+7 km**)  \n",
    "- **Trip c** (P→1→3→7→P): the return from 7 goes 7→2→P = 24 km, making the actual trip 53 km, not 59. They actually **overestimated** this one. (**-6 km**)\n",
    "\n",
    "The errors partially cancel out (+2 +7 -6 = +3 km), so their claimed 323 km is actually 326 km.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why did the greedy algorithm lose?** Because nearest-neighbor is short-sighted: it always picks the closest node next, which can lead to inefficient return trips later. The classmates made smarter strategic choices — like combining node 6 and 5 deliveries into one deep trip (trip a), even though those nodes are far from P. \n",
    "\n",
    "The greedy algorithm is a heuristic, not an exact solver. For small problems like this, thoughtful manual planning can beat it!"
