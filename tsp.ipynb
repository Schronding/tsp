The most simple solution I can think of is simply anidating loops. \n",

It just follows `i`, but what is more confusing is that when I change the indexes of the other loops to something resembling a factorial (5 then 4, then 3 ... and so on) I get just one result. Could it be that I am creating a cycle in which the root bounces back and forth just from the first value?... if that is the answer then why I don't get `GDL` ad nauseum? \n",

I am thinking in creating a flag that checks the weight, and as all values are positive and non-zero (except when you're at the same node you want to visit) I can ignore those values. I wonder if the `break` clause could work well here, as I think it would be a good way to go one step up when the case is that we stay on the same city... What I don't know is if it is in my interest to go to a loop above or if I should move the current index one step to the right.\n",
