That means for the first node I have 5, then 4, then 3 and so on up until I reach to the final node, which should be iteration five. Lets experiment with code to see if my assumption is real."

    "As always I forget that jupyter is an extension. I now see that `pip install jupyter-notebook` is not correct. It seems that I can install `notebook` and `jupyter` separately, but I don't know what the differences are. I will go with jupyter just to be sure. Even when I have installed jupyter it still says that I must select the kernel... why? When I try to manually select my `.venv` folder as the kernel I get prompted with just two options: Install/Enable suggested extensions and Browse marketplace for kernel extensions. I see that the number one is Jupyter with 101.2 million downloads. \n",
